Candycrush with Javascript

HTML setup:
1. <html lang="en" dir="ltr">
--dir="ltr" specifies the dirention of the text in HTML document.
--ltr sets the text direction from left to right.
2.Place script tag in header in order to use addEventListeners to the DOM.
-- <script src="./app.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
--Setting the charset=utf-8 character encoding in the script file specifies encoding =utf-8
3.Create div with the class of grid ,this will represent the canvas.
--<div class="grid"></div>

-----
=======
CSS setup:
1.Edit grid to be displayed with 8x8 squares.
-This could be done by *70px by 8 which will give the height and width of the grid 560px.
2.Set the display to flex to cause squares to stack row by row while setting flex-wrap to wrap
  so the grid breaks when the squares overflow set pixels.
.grid{
    height:560px;
    width:560px;
    display:flex;
    flex-wrap:wrap;
    background-color:blue;

}
-----
1.Create another grid div for future use via javascript
-The setting of 70px could be adjusted to a higher quantity for more squares to be added or to
hold a larger number of squares before breaking or wrapping to the next row.
.grid div {
    height: 70px;
    width:70px;
}

======================
Javascript setup
1. Add event listener to the dom to check if content has loaded.
--Javascript code is placed inside this code block.
--Note current script tag is placed in header to load script but the HTML will be read first due to DOMContentLoaded. 
the addEventListener is set to the DOMContentLoaded.
---------------------------
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",() =>{
const grid = document.querySelector('.grid');
const width = 8;	//sets the square count to 8 .
const squares =[];   //dynamic array that will hold the number of squares.
 });
2.Create board which uses a loop to add squares to grid in order to create board.
-Use a for loop to multipling the width which is 8 by width which is 8,
-By creating an element(div)in this case=>document.createElement('div');
-next use appendChild to attack squares to grid.
----------------------------------------
for(let i =0; i<width*width; i++){
        const square = document.createElement('div');
        grid.appendChild(square);
	squares.push(square); //push each individual square into squares array.
